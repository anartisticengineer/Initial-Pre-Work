# TG-Pre-Work

### While we do want our developers to work smarter, not harder, please refrain from plagiarizing.  It is completely fine to reword information you have gleaned from internet sources, however, please be prepared to redo the work should you submit a directly copied/pasted answer.  If you must copy/paste, cite your sources (this citation doesn't need to be fancy - just state directly where you found the information or provide a link).  Additionally, some of the questions below are tricky.  The answers were not necessarily covered in the reading we assigned.  They are not intended to be straightforward because we expect you to do some research to discover the answers to the best of your ability.  If you cannot find an answer, explain what you do know and what you are stuck on.  

## When we hit https://www.techtonic.com/ what happens? Don’t focus too much on architecture (Monolithic, SOA, Microservices, etc.). Try to focus more on how the web functions in general terms/steps.

As the client, entering the URL signifies that you are requesting the page from the server
associated with the domain 'www.techtonic.com'. This associated server will then check to see if the requested
page is available as the screen loads. When successful, the page will be sent back to the client, and rendered as
the HTML page.

## From start to finish, how does data reach you to be rendered in the browser?

When the client requests the data from the server, the server will then search for the requested data
and deliver it alongside a static HTML document. When successfully loaded, this HTML code is then rendered in the browser.
This is the sign of a dynamic webpage relying on server and client-side development.

## What code is rendered in the browser?

Front-End : HTML/CSS/Javascript

## What is the server-side code’s main function?

The server-side (back-end) deals mostly with handling larger amounts of complex data, usually dealing
with data from MANY users (databases): hence why this code is handled by servers instead of personal computers.

## What is the client-side code’s main function?

The client-side (front-end) deals mostly with anything involving the user experience,
from typical browsing to filling out forms/submissions.

## What is runtime?

Runtime is the amount of time it takes for a computer program to run from start to finish.

## How many instances of the client-side assets (HTML, CSS, JS, Images, etc.) are created?

1 HTML, 1 CSS, 8 Javascript, 19 Images, 4 Fonts (Found from viewing the source code directly).

## How many instances of the server-side code are available at any given time?

8 Javascript(?): some of the viewed Javascript deals with server side functions
(I realize that Javascript can be used for front-end and back-end).
## How many instances of the databases connected to the server application are created?

5 (I believe this deals with cookies and session storage?)
