//Concatenating strings can also easily be done when some strings are variables.
// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Justin Johnson";
var myStr = "My name is "+ myName +" and I am well!";
